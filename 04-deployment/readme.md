# üöÄ Deploying The Backend

We'll deploy the app piece by piece, and at first we'll deploy & configure things in a sub-optimal way.
This is in order to explore the Kubernetes concepts and show their purpose. Then we'll iterate and
improve towards the final architecture.

We have three "microservices" we need to deploy, and due to dependencies between them we'll start with
the MongoDB database then the data API and then move onto the frontend.

From here we will be creating and editing files, so it's worth creating a project folder locally (or
even a git repo) in order to work from if you haven't done so already.

## üçÉ Deploying MongoDB

We'll apply configurations to Kubernetes using `kubectl` and YAML manifest files, and we'll be doing
this a lot throughout the workshop. These files will describe the objects we want to create, modify
and delete in the cluster.

If you want to take this workshop slowly and treat it as more of a hack, you can research and build
the required YAML yourself, you can use [the Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
and the following hints:

- _Deployment_ should be used with a single replica.
- The image to be run is `mongo:5.0`. Note: This is not really part of our app, so we pull it from the
  [public MongoDB image hosted on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo), not the ACR we set up.
- The port **27017** should be exposed from the container.
- Do not worry about persistence or using a _Service_ at this point.
- Pass `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environmental vars to the container
  setting the username to "admin" and password to "supersecret".

Alternatively you can use the YAML below to paste into `mongo-deployment.yaml`, don't worry this isn't
cheating, in the real world everyone is too busy to write Kubernetes manifests from scratch üòâ

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here for the MongoDB deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1

metadata:
  name: mongodb

spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mongodb-container

          image: mongo:5.0
          imagePullPolicy: Always

          ports:
            - containerPort: 27017

          env:
            - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
              value: admin
            - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: supersecret
```

</details>

Then apply the manifest with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml
```

If successful you will see `deployment.apps/mongodb created`, this will have created one _Deployment_
and one _Pod_. You can check the status of your cluster with a few commands:

- `kubectl get deployment` - List the deployments, you should see 1/1 in ready status.
- `kubectl get pod` - List the pods, you should see one prefixed `mongodb-` with a status of _Running_.
- `kubectl describe deploy mongodb` - Examine and get details of the deployment.
- `kubectl describe pod {podname}` - Examine the pod, you will need to get the name from the `get pod`
  command.
- `kubectl get all` - List everything; all pods, deployments etc.

Get used to these commands you will use them a LOT when working with Kubernetes.

For the next part we'll need the IP address of the pod that was just deployed, you can get this by
running `kubectl get pod -o wide` or the command below:

```bash
kubectl describe pod --selector app=mongodb | grep ^IP:
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Deploying The Data API

Next we'll deploy the first custom part of our app, the data API, and we'll deploy it from an image
hosted in our private registry.

- The image needs to be `{ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/smilr/data-api:stable` where `{ACR_NAME}` should be
  replaced in the YAML with your real value, i.e. the name of your ACR resource.
- Set the number of replicas to **2**.
- The port exposed from the container should be **4000**.
- An environmental variable called `MONGO_CONNSTR` should be passed to the container, with the connection
  string to connect to the MongoDB, which will be `mongodb://admin:supersecret@{MONGODB_POD_IP}` where
  `{MONGODB_POD_IP}` should be replaced in the YAML with the pod IP address you just queried.
- Label the pods with `app: data-api`.

Again you can try building the _Deployment_ yourself or use the provided YAML to create a `data-api-deployment.yaml` file

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here for the DataAPI deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1

metadata:
  name: data-api

spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: data-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: data-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: data-api-container

          image: {ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/smilr/data-api:stable
          imagePullPolicy: Always

          ports:
            - containerPort: 4000

          env:
            - name: MONGO_CONNSTR
              value: mongodb://admin:supersecret@{MONGODB_POD_IP}
```

</details>

**üí• Notice:** We have the password in plain text within the connection string! This clearly is a very
bad practice, we will fix this at a later stage when we introduce Kubernetes _Secrets_.

Make the changes described above, **remember to make the edits, you can not use this YAML as is**,
and then run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f data-api-deployment.yaml
```

Check the status as before with `kubectl` and it's worth checking the logs with `kubectl logs {podname}`
to see the output from the app as it starts up.

This time we've set the number of replicas to two, if you run `kubectl get pods -o wide` you will see
which _Nodes_ the _Pods_ have been scheduled (assigned) to. You should see each _Pod_ has been scheduled
to different _Nodes_, but this is not guaranteed. _Pod_ scheduling and placement is a fairly complex
topic, for now we can move on.

## ‚è© Accessing the Data API (The quick & dirty way)

Now it would be nice to access and call this API, to check it's working. But the IP address of the
_Pods_ are private and only accessible from within the cluster. In the next section we'll fix that,
but for now there's a short-cut we can use.

Kubernetes provides a way to "tunnel" network traffic into the cluster through the control plane,
this is done with the `kubectl port-forward` command.

Pick the name of either one of the two `data-api` _Pods_, and run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward {pod_name} 4000:4000
```

And then accessing the following URL [http://localhost:4000/api/info](http://localhost:4000/api/info)
either in your browser or with `curl` we should see a JSON response with some status and debug
information from the API.

```sh
curl http://localhost:4000/api/info | json_pp
```

Clearly this isn't a good way to expose your apps long term, but can be extremely useful when debugging
and triaging issues.

When done, cancel the port-forwarding with ctrl-c
