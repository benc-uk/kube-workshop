# üåê Basic Networking

Pods are both ephemeral and "mortal", they should be considered effectively transient.
Kubernetes can terminate and reschedule pods for a whole range of reasons, including rolling updates, hitting resource limits, scaling up & down and other cluster operations.
With Pods being transient, you can not build a reliable architecture through addressing Pods directly (e.g. by name or IP address), because no part of a pod is static.

Kubernetes solves this with _Services_, which act as a network abstraction over a group of pods, and have their own lifecycle.
We can use them to greatly improve what we've deployed.

## üß© Deploy MongoDB Service

Now to put a _Service_ in front of the MongoDB pods, if you want to create the service YAML yourself, you can [refer to the Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service).

- The type of _Service_ should be `ClusterIP` which means it's internal to the cluster only.
- The service port should be **27017**.
- The target port should be **27017**.
- Selector decides what pods are behind the service, in this case use the label `app` and the value
  `mongodb`.

> üìù NOTE: Labels are optional metadata that can be added to any object in Kubernetes, they are simply key-value pairs. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects.
> The label "app" is commonly used, but has **no special meaning**, and isn't used by Kubernetes in any way

Save your YAML into a file `mongo-service.yaml` or use the below YAML manifest for the service:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here for the MongoDB service YAML</summary>

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  # We purposefully pick a different name for the service from the deployment
  name: database

spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
```

</details>

Apply it to the cluster as before:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mongo-service.yaml
```

You can use `kubectl` to examine the status of the _Service_ just like you can with _Pods_ and _Deployments_:

```bash
# Get all services
kubectl get svc

# Get details of a single service
kubectl describe svc {service-name}
```

> üìù NOTE: The service called 'kubernetes' exists in every namespace and is placed there automatically, you can ignore it.

üõë **IMPORTANT NOTE**: As a rule it's a bad idea and generally considered an "anti-pattern" to run stateful services in Kubernetes. Managing them is complex and time consuming.
It's **strongly recommended** use PaaS data offerings which reside outside your cluster and can be managed independently and easily.
We will continue with MongoDB running in the cluster purely as a learning exercise.

## üì° Connect the API to MongoDB Service

Now we have a Service in our cluster for MongoDB we can access the database using DNS rather than pod IP and if the pod(s) die or restart or move; this name remains constant.
DNS with Kubernetes is a complex topic we won't get into here, the main takeaway for now is:

- Every _Service_ in the cluster can be resolved over DNS
- Within a _Namespace_, the _Service_ name will resolve as a simple hostname, without the need for a
  DNS suffix [but other scenarios](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)
  also are supported.

Edit the the `data-api-deployment.yaml` file you created previously and change the value of the
`MONGO_CONNSTR` environmental variable.
Replace the IP address with name of the service, e.g. the connection string should look like `mongodb://admin:supersecret@database`.

You can update the active deployment with these changes by re-running `kubectl apply -f data-api-deployment.yaml`.
Kuberenetes will perform a rolling update, if you are quick and run `kubectl get pods` you might see it taking place, i.e. a new pod starting & the old one terminating.
Again you can check the status and the logs using `kubectl`.

## üåç Expose the Data API externally

We can create a different type of _Service_ in front of the data API, in order to expose it outside of the cluster and also to the internet.
To do this use a Service with the type `NodePort`.
This service will then expose the traffic on IP address of the VM and the port specified as `nodePort`, in our case it'll be port `30036`.

In a traditional cluster, like AKS, we would instead use _Service_ of type `LoadBalancer`. This then would be picked up by Azure and a public IP assigned and traffic routed through an Azure LoadBalancer in front of the cluster.
With a bare metal cluster there aren't any load balancers.

> üì∞ INFO: For more information on different service types, you can check out: [Kubernetes NodePort vs LoadBalancer vs Ingress? When should I use what?](https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-nodeport-vs-loadbalancer-vs-ingress-when-should-i-use-what-922f010849e0)
> (We'll touch on ingress in later chapters as well.)

We can also change the port at the _Service_ level, so the port exposed by the _Service_ doesn't need to match the one that the container is listening on.
In this case we'll re-map the port to **80**.

Save your YAML into a file `data-api-service.yaml` from above or below.

<https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-nodeport-vs-loadbalancer-vs-ingress-when-should-i-use-what-922f010849e0>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here for the data API service YAML</summary>

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: data-api

spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: data-api
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 4000
      nodePort: 30036
```

</details>

Apply it to the cluster as before:

```bash
kubectl apply -f data-api-service.yaml
```

Using `kubectl get svc` check the status. Then go to the address in your browser `http://{VM_IP}:30036/api/info/` and you should get the same JSON response as before.

Clearly this is better than what we had before, but in production you would never expose traffic directly into your pods like this.
Later we can improve this yet further, but for now it will suffice.

> üìù NOTE: If your connection is timing out, make sure that the port is exposed on your VM.
