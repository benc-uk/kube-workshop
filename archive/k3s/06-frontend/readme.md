# üíª Adding The Frontend

We've ignored the frontend until this point, with the API and backend in place we are finally ready to deploy it.
We need to use a _Deployment_ and _Service_ just as before. We can pick up the pace a little and setup everything we need in one go.

For the Deployment:

- The image needs to be `{ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/smilr/frontend:stable`.
- The port exposed from the container should be **3000**
- An environmental variable called `API_ENDPOINT` should be passed to the container, this needs to be a URL and should point to the VM IP and the `nodePort` the API is exposed from the previous part, as follows `http://{VM_IP}:30036/api`.
- Label the pods with `app: frontend`.

For the Service:

- The type of _Service_ should be `NodePort` same as the data API.
- The service port should be **80**.
- The target port should be **3000**.
- The node port should be **30037**.
- Use the label `app` and the value `frontend` for the selector.

You might like to try creating the service before deploying the pods to see what happens.
The YAML you can use for both, is provided below:

`frontend-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1

metadata:
  name: frontend

spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: frontend-container

          image: {ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/smilr/frontend:stable
          imagePullPolicy: Always

          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000

          env:
            - name: API_ENDPOINT
              value: http://{VM_IP}:30036/api
```

</details>

`frontend-service.yaml`:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here for the frontend service YAML</summary>

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: frontend

spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 30037
```

</details>

As before, the there are changes that are required to the supplied YAML, replacing anything inside `{ }` with a corresponding real value.

## üí° Accessing and Using the App

Once the two YAMLs have been applied:

- Check the service is up and running with `kubectl get svc frontend`.
- Once it is there, go to the VM IP in your browser, e.g. `http://{VM_IP}:30037/` - the application should load and the Smilr frontend is shown.

If you want to spend a few minutes using the app, you can go to the "Admin" page, add a new event, the details don't matter but make the date range to include the current date.
And try out the feedback view and reports. Or simply be happy the app is functional and move on.

## üñºÔ∏è Cluster & Architecture Diagram

The resources deployed into the cluster & in Azure at this stage can be visualized as follows:

Here we can see our two `NodePort` services, each exposed on different ports of the external VM IP.
